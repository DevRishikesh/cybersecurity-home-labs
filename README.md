# Cybersecurity Home Labs

This repository contains my hands-on cybersecurity home labs and projects.  
All labs are performed in a controlled environment for learning defensive and offensive security concepts.

The goal of this repository is to build strong practical skills in Linux, networking, scripting, and system security through real-world simulations.
